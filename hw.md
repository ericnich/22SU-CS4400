Please find your homework assignments on Gradescope. From Canvas, you
will find links to starter files. You can also find them available at our class's [repository]({{ github.repository }}).

# Assignment Guidelines

   1. You must use `#lang racket` for these homework.

   1. You must test your solutions before submitting your
      assignment. We may have provided you some test cases to clarify the prose and
	  to get you started, but the provided test cases are not
      exhaustive.

   1. Follow the [design
      recipe](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2500/design_recipe.html). If
      you are new to this you can see the
      [textbook](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_one.html#%28part._sec~3adesign-func%29)
      for more details.
   
   1. We expect to see data definitions, signatures, and purpose
      statements. We're flexible viz the "syntax" you use for your
      signatures and data definitions, but we want to see them.

   1. Your solutions must be naturally recursive or you will lose
      credit.

   1. Remember, you need not and should not consider bad data in your
      definition.

   1. You may not use built-in procedures that handle the bulk of the
      work. For example, you may not use the append function from
      Racket to implement your append. But once you have defined your
      own function for a problem, feel free to use it for subsequent
      problems.

   1. The objective is not simply to write programs that get the
      correct answers; it is to write answers in the style of programs
      written in class.

   1. Please feel free to submit your work as many times as you wish,
      we will grade the last submission prior to the due date (and
      time).

   1. I have linked notes and resources for you on the schedule; you
      should consult them.
