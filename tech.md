The following is a list of technologies with which I expect you to familiarize yourself and be prepared to use
as a part of participating in our class.


## [Duo 2FA](https://get2fa.northeastern.edu/)

Most if not all students will already have enrolled themselves for the
Duo 2FA system. It is essential that you do so to access
Northeastern's digital resources. Northeastern has at least two
tutorials for installing and using the Duo 2FA system:

   - [The express version](https://express.northeastern.edu/get2fa/how-to-enroll-in-2fa/)
   - [The `servicenow` guide, (with pictures)](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sys_kb_id=436cd1dbdb808854c5575e38dc9619e3&sysparm_class_name=kb_knowledge)

## Piazza 

[Piazza.com](http://piazza.com/) hosts our main Q&A forum. We are everyone learning; no one
knows all the answers, and remember that everyone wears their best and
most knowledgeable face. For questions related to the course material,
assignments, policies, or what have you, please utilize Piazza. I
generally prefer anonymous Piazza posts over email---this way others
get the benefit of your thoughtful question and answers and
corrections scale to the size of our class. Please do anonymize them
if you wish; we can see even if you cannot. Frequently someone will
have the same concern or be feeling the same way.

 If it doesn't "give away the punchline" of some homework question or
 assignment, *necessitate* PII in the question or the answer, and isn't
 contrary to FERPA or your rights under the Northeastern University
 Handbook, please do consider if this can be a Piazza message.

## [KCCS/CCIS/CCS Github](http://ccs.github.neu.edu)

I will be utilizing the school's Enterprise git at
[http://ccs.github.neu.edu]. You should have access to that with your
KCCS account. I will expect you to know how to access this, for your
own benefits and for coursework. If you are not familiar, please
consult the Khoury Systems group's [documentation and
walk-through](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0012152).

If you are unfamiliar with `git` itself, you should make sure you have git installed on your system and then
type `git help everyday` and `git help tutorials` to familiarize yourself with the tool.

## Course Homepage

I constructed our course homepage as a Jekyll site built with Github
Pages. Student corrections and improvements are *incredibly* welcome!
You should submit [pull requests
(PR)](http://github.ccs.neu.edu/jhemann/22SU-CS4400) for
corrections and improvements. Every page on this website has a direct
links to its `.md` file in this repository.

If you are unfamiliar with making pull requests, you can find plenty of documentation both from your terminal
and [on the
web](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Gradescope

This semester you will use Gradescope to submit your homework and in-class quizzes. This is an alternative technology to the Handin
server that you might have used in other classes. You will see this item in the Canvas menu for our course.

## Zoom 

I intend to broadcast our course meetings via [Northeastern Zoom](https://northeastern.zoom.us/). I
prefer it over MS Teams for a variety of reasons. Not the least of
which is the instantaneous and anonymous feedback that it provides,
via [Dial testing](http://dialsmith.com/blog/dial-tests-vs-focus-groups-how-are-they-different/). You will find it helpful to have two
internet-enabled devices with at hand when you are attending class
remotely, once for viewing the class and a second for answering poll
questions.

### Via direct installation. 

If you have difficulty installing or using the platform please see
ITS' associated [KB article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us) or contact [Zoom support](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us).

### Via the browser

You also have the option to join without downloading or installing any
software, via the [Zoom web client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214629443-Zoom-web-client). The web client does not have all
the functionality of the desktop or mobile apps; please see the
comparison [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360027397692#query:~:text=Note%3A,-We). 

## NEU VPN 

Go to [https://vpn.northeastern.edu](https://vpn.northeastern.edu), and follow the instructions to
install the GlobalProctect VPN client on your machine. You will need
this to use the VDI linux machines. If you have difficulty please
consult the [relevant ITS KB articles](http://northeastern.service-now.com/tech?id=kb_category&kb_category=07d42f714f02cf0099c2fd511310c7b2), and if necessary [reach out to
ITS support](http://its.northeastern.edu/support/#et-boc:~:text=Still%20Need%20Support%3F).

## VDI Linux Machines 

[Khoury VDI Virtual
Desktops](http://khoury.northeastern.edu/systems/vdi/), and the
[relevant ITS KB
articles](http://northeastern.service-now.com/tech?id=kb_category&kb_category=6b863d8d4f3b5b4450a5798e0210c735&kb_id=d82ad28c134922401528f5104244b068).

## Racket

[Download](https://download.racket-lang.org/) and install Racket and
the DrRacket integrated development environment. To begin with, I will
use DrRacket in front of the classroom to demonstrate Racket and
miniKanren programming, and I want you all to follow along and to
practice during designated practice periods.

### Rackunit

We will also use the
[Rackunit](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/) unit testing
framework. This is another Racket package. We will use this as a
substitute for the `check-expect` you might have come to appreciate if
you have already taken Fundamentals I at NEU. We make this
substitution because `check-expect` doesn't exist in the full `racket`
language.

### Other packages as they come up

Prepare yourself to download and install other packages as necessary
to make our test suites run. You will not need any additional packages
to complete your homework, nor should you use them.
