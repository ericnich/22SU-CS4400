As a future professional computer scientist, you should be comfortable
learning new programming languages, even those that have not yet been
invented. The way to do this is to understand the underlying
principles of programming languages. That is the goal of this course.

In the course of a software developer's career, languages will
trend in and out of fashion. Understanding programming language (PL)
principles helps you keep pace in a rapidly changing
field. Furthermore, recent trends toward domain-specific languages
mean many developers will need to design their own languages. This
course teaches these skills, contextualizes the history and breadth of
programming language design, and familiarizes students with both
current and upcoming future trends.
