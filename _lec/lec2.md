# All the Racket you need to know x2

## Again, it's important to write this *style* of programs

### `length`


### `count8`

```racket
(define (count8 ls)
  (cond
    ((null? ls) 0)
    ((eqv? (car ls) 8) (add1 (count8 (cdr ls))))
    (else (count8 (cdr ls)))))
```

### `count8*`

```racket
(define (count8* ls)
  (cond
    ((null? ls) 0)
    ;; this is our test for listitude 
    ;; we have a list, and it's car is a list
    ((pair? (car ls)) (+ (count8* (car ls)) (count8* (cdr ls))))
    ((eqv? (car ls) 8) (add1 (count8* (cdr ls))))
    (else (count8* (cdr ls)))))
```

	```racket
(count8* '(4 (8 (5 (((8)) 7))) (3 8)))
3
```

# Arithmetic examples.


## `plus`

## `times`

## `expt` 

## Generalizing 

### This is not news.

```racket
(define (phi p m n)
  (cond
    [(zero? p) (+ m n)]
    [(and (zero? n) (zero? (sub1 p))) 0]
    [(and (zero? n) (zero? (sub1 (sub1 p)))) 1]
    [(zero? n) m]
    [else (phi (sub1 p) m (phi p m (sub1 n)))]))
```
