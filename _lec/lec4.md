# Questions

-   Homework coming due soon. Yeah?
-   Great Piazza questions! Keep up the good and awesomeness!
-   Debugging help. Stub out functions to get our outputs

# Review

-   `match`
-   our three lines

# The interpreter

This is today\'s big idea. One of the questions we can ask about these
`lambda`-calculus expressions is: what is the *value*? And its the same
pattern as writing any other program over `lambda`-calculus expressions.

We will add some forms beyond just our 3 lines, but we don\'t *have* to.
And you could add more if you wanted, too!

## We can add some lines for some other primitives 

- `numbers`
- `if`
- `add1`
- `*`

Note how these aren't *exactly* completely independent, but I did it
b/c I want you to be able to run your programs in Racket
