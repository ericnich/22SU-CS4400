# The interpreter

This is today\'s big idea. One of the questions we can ask about these
`lambda`-calculus expressions is: what is the *value*? And its the same
pattern as writing any other program over `lambda`-calculus expressions.

We will add some forms beyond just our 3 lines, but we don\'t *have* to.
And you could add more if you wanted, too!
