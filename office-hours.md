# Office Hours Location and Format

Following Univerersity and College guidance, this semester we will
hold office hours remotely. Our TA staff will use the [Khoury Office
Hours system](https://khouryofficehours.com/), helping students on a
first-come, first-serve basis.

### Ryan

I will be holding office hours on Wednesday 6pm-8pm EST.

However, you don't need to wait a week to talk to me. Here's how you can reach me when I'm not holding OH, in order of preference:

1. See me after class, we can talk outside the classroom. I'll be in lecture most days until May 20th.
2. [Book a time to meet with me](https://calendly.com/jung-ry/meeting).
3. Send an [email](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/) to `jung.ry@northeastern.edu`.
4. DM me on Teams ðŸ¤®.

I will almost always be free to answer questions and meet during key times (right before homeworks are due and in the week preceeding exams).
