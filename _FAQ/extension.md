title: May I please have an extension on this assignment?
---

I can't give you a personal extension. With as many students as we
have and as many graders as we have (often volunteers) the only way to
manage that level of chaos fairly to all parties involved is to adhere
strictly to policy. In this instance, meaning no late work. But I'll
mention at least some problems on every assignment are imminently
doable, so at the very least you can have something done). We allow
unlimited submissions, so if you have chances to iteratively improve
things, you can do that. Swing by office hours and be studying when
you can to catch up. You might pick some things up by osmosis.

If your difficulties are at all a matter of office hours timing not
working well for you, let me know if there's another time that we can
meet with you and help. If we don't have hours during that period,
lemme know when'll work, and if I can't meet with you then, I'm almost
certain there's someone who can. I want everyone to know that we
applied a policy one way for one group, and another way for another.
