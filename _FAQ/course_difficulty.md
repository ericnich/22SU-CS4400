title: How difficult is this course?
---

The difficulty of a course is a subjective assessment. Portions of a
course that might be easy for one student might be difficult for
another and vice versa. However, there are some recognized approaches
to gauging the difficulty of a class. I invite you to take the content
of our course syllabus and estimates for your individual self the
subjective values and plug them into this [course difficulty
estimator](https://cat.wfu.edu/resources/tools/estimator2/) and come
up with your own approximation of how much time you will need to spend
in and out of class on these assignments.
