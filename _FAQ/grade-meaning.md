title: I got [some grade] out of 10 on my homework. Why is that?
---

While you've received a homework grade out of a maximum 10 points,
these grades do not correspond 1-to-1 with a letter grade or
percentage. Our homework policy is described in [the syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#homework),
and the meaning of your numeric grade can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/grading_flowchart.png).
The letter grade (or equivalent) that your grade on a homework
will correspond to will be decided towards or at the end of
the semester.

If you have additional questions, feel free to reach out to
the TA that graded your assignment or myself.
