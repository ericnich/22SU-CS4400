#| Assignment Guidelines |#

;; You will likely find memv, remv, assv, and letrec useful.

;; A lambda-calculus expressions is one of:
;;  - variables (implemented as symbols)
;;  - lambda expressions that take exactly one argument and have exactly one body
;;  - applications (lists of exactly two lambda calculus expressions)

;; In this assignment, you will use the functions you define in the
;; first section as helpers in the later problems.

;; An association list is a list of pairs of associated values. For
;; example, the following is an association list:
;; '((a . 5) (b . (1 2)) (c . a))

;; You must use match in each of the problems from section 2 of this
;; assignment, unless the assigrment states otherwise. 

;; Most of section 2's problems require both match and recursion on
;; lambda-calculus expressions.

;; You may find match also simplifies other problems.

;; The match features we demonstrated in class are sufficient. Do not
;; use features of match we did not discuss in class.

;; Here and forevermore in this class we use the word occur in its
;; technical sense: for us, a formal parameter does not count as a
;; variable occurrence.

;; Yes, a variable can both occur free and occur bound in the same
;; expression. 

;; In a subset of Racket where lambdas have only one argument, the
;; lexical address of a variable is the number of lambdas between the
;; place where the variable is bound (i.e. the formal parameter) and
;; the place where it occurs. The o at the very bottom of the
;; following expression is a bound occurrence. It has a lexical
;; address of 4, because there are four lambda expressions between the
;; formal parameter o at the top and the occurrence of o at the
;; bottom.

(lambda (o)
  (lambda (r)
    (lambda (s)
      (lambda (p)
        (lambda (g)
          o)))))

#| Part I Natural Recursion Refresher |# 

#| 

1. Consider the following incomplete definition of the list-ref
function. It should behave like Racket's list-ref.

|# 

(define (list-ref ls n)
  (letrec
    ([nth-cdr
      (Î» (n)
        ;; complete the definition
        )])
    (car (nth-cdr n))))

;; The inner, nested function nth-cdr needs its body. Complete the
;; list-ref's definition by completing a naturally-recursive
;; implementation of nth-cdr, so that the following tests pass. You
;; must not modify the provided code beyond adding a body. You may of
;; course add newlines as needed. Do not call list-ref, either ours or
;; Racket's, in your definition.

#|

2. Define and test a procedure union that takes two lists, where
neither list contains the same element twice (that is, the list
represents a set), and returns a list containing the union of the two
input lists. Again, the order of the elements in your answer does not
matter. You should use memv on this problem. 

|# 

#| 

3. Define and test a procedure extend that takes two arguments, say x
and a predicate pred. (Recall from the previous assignment the
definition of a predicate.) extend should return a predicate. The
returned predicate should hold for exactly those things that are eqv?
to x or satisfy pred.

|# 


#| 

4. Define and test a procedure walk-symbol that takes an atom x and an
association list of symbols to atoms. Your procedure should search
through s for the value associated with x. If the associated value is
a symbol, it too must be walked in s. If x has no association, then
walk-symbol should return x. You should use assv on this
problem. Cycles are absolutely bad data.

|#

#| 

5. Define and test a procedure lambda->lumbda that takes a
lambda-calculus expression and returns the expression unchanged with
the exception that each lambda as a keyword has been replaced with the
word lumbda (notice you should not change occurrences of lambda in
variable position).

|# 


#| 

6. Define and test a procedure var-occurs? that takes a variable name
and a lambda-calculus expression and returns a boolean answering
whether that variable occurs in the expression. 

|# 


#| 

7. Define and test a procedure vars that takes a lambda-calculus
expression and returns a list containing all variables that occur in
the expression. This should be a straightforward modification of
lambda->lumbda, and the order of the variables in your answer does not
matter.

|#


#| 

8. Define and test a function called unique-vars that behaves like
vars but does not return duplicates. Use union in your definition.

|#


#| 

9. Define and test a procedure var-occurs-free? that takes a symbol
and a lambda-calculus expression and returns #t if that variable
occurs free in that expression, and #f otherwise. You may have seen
solutions in class to these problems that use accumulators. You are
not permitted to use accumulators on these problems; such solutions do
not receive credit.

|#


#| 

10. Define and test a procedure var-occurs-bound? that takes a symbol
and a lambda-calculus expression and returns #t if that variable
occurs bound in the expression, and #f otherwise.

|# 


#| 

11. Define and test a procedure unique-free-vars that takes a
lambda-calculus expression and returns a list of all the variables
that occur free in that expression. Order doesn't matter, but the list
must not contain duplicate variables. You may find it helpful to use
the definition of unique-vars as a starting point.

|#

;; Note that for instance

;; '((lambda (x) ((x y) e)) (lambda (c) (x (lambda (x) (x (e c))))))

;; is a single lambda-calculus expression (a procedure application),
;; not a list of lambda-calculus expressions.

#| 

12. Define and test a procedure unique-bound-vars that takes a
lambda-calculus expression and returns a list of all the variables
that occur bound in the input expression. Order doesn't matter, but
the list must not contain duplicate variables.

|# 



#| 

13. Define and test a procedure lex that takes a lambda-calculus
expression and an accumulator (which starts as the empty list), and
returns the same expression with all bound variable references
replaced by lists of two elements whose car is the symbol var and
whose cadr is the lexical address of the referenced
variable. Expressions with free variables are bad data. 

This problem has several good solutions. I suggest you start by
building some lambda expressions on paper and then, by hand, find the
lexical addresses of some variables that occur in them. Try and do it
almost mechanically, starting from the top of the expression and
working your way down. Then think about what it is you're doing, and
try and figure out how to do it without having to go back up the
tree. That is, ensure that when you get to a variable position in the
expression where you need to fill in the lexical address, that you
already have all the information you need to figure it out. Then code
that.

If you find the list-index-ofv function from your hw1
will help you, copy it over to this file.

;; Boxes are mutable memory references, meaning we can change the
;; value the box contains. You will find it useful to consult the
;; [Racket Documentation about
;; boxes](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/boxes.html) for
;; information about the box, unbox, and set-box! functions for this
;; problem.

;; For this problem we will now, instead, write our association list
;; such that the right-hand side of each association is always a box
;; that contains a value.

;; Without boxes (or some side-effect) we would have to (re-)copy the
;; entire data structure each time we wanted to change a portion of
;; the data structure.

;; Consider again the scenario of the walk-symbol problem. Imagine
;; that we frequently look up values in that association list.

#| 

14. You will implement walk-symbol-update, a version of walk-symbol
that implements path-compression. The function walk-symbol may become
prohibitively expensive, as certain perverse chains may be arbitrarily
long. Consider the work you would have to do to walk a0 twice in the
following association list.

'((z . 26) (y . z) (x . y) ... (b . c) (a0 . b))

With path-compression, when the function walks the association list to
find the final value for the symbol we started with, it also changes
the values in boxes we had to walk through along the way (this
sequence is called the path) so that the right-hand side of each of
those also contains the final value. Thus, if we have to walk that
same symbol again, the lookup will be faster. See the following
example:

> (define a-list `((c . ,(box 15)) (e . ,(box 'f)) (b . ,(box 'c)) (a . ,(box 'b))))
> a-list
((c . #&15) (e . #&f) (b . #&c) (a . #&b))
> (walk-symbol-update 'a a-list)
15
> a-list
((c . #&15) (e . #&f) (b . #&15) (a . #&15))
> (walk-symbol-update 'a a-list)
15
> a-list
((c . #&15) (e . #&f) (b . #&15) (a . #&15))

;; In order to return multiple values, you should see the Racket
;; documentation on values and let-values (and call-with-values though
;; you probably won't need it to define var-occurs-both?).

;; I use the chk library for testing here because it copes better with
;; values

#| 

15. Define a predicate var-occurs-both? that takes a variable x and a
lambda-calculus expression, and returns two values, the first of which
is a boolean answering whether the variable occurs free in the
expression, and the second is a boolean answering whether the var
occurs bound in the expression. Your solution should be a one-pass
solution, meaning you should not recur over the same data twice, and
you should not use an accumulator.
